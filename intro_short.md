BitDust is a distributed on-line storage, in which only owner has an access to the data.

Imagine a situation when two friends and you agree to help each other to store the data. On your computer you store the data that both of your friends uploaded to you via Internet, and you in turn can use the free space on their machines to save your files. This creates redundancy, but allows storing important data in a safer way. It is also a fair deal, because all three are interested in the maximum safety and availability of stored information.

BitDust network is a voluntary association of people sharing resources of their personal computers. Their machines run the same copies of BitDust program, which enables all device communications. The data are transmitted from one user to another and stored on user hard disk drives.

BitDust also protects your privacy - the software can route the incoming and outgoing traffic via third node, so you can operate anonymously and be independent and safe.




BitDust is an open-source project of a worldwide distributed peer-to-peer network that is aiming to provide online storage, safe personal communications and full control of your own private data.

By design, BitDust network does not have any centralization - your device communicates with other devices in the network peer-to-peer via encrypted and digitally signed packets. There is no any governance, accounting or monitoring of the users required (or even possible).

This story is about respecting our digital freedoms and making people independent as much as possible. It may sound much too optimistic, but that is my lifestyle: all or nothing! More about the project you can read on www.bitdust.io
