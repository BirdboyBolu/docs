# How to start a new Identity Server in BitDust network


## Intro

You need to create new identity for your own to be able to communicate with other nodes and access BitDust community.
Identity files are distributed across identity servers in the network, other nodes holding and exposing copies of your identity.

The third node can access that ID server and download your identity to be able to talk to you.
So any node in the network can start own ID server and help to maintain network and make it more reliable.

Your global IDURL is formed based on your nickname and DNS name (or IP address) of the first ID server.

If one of your ID servers is down, you can find a fresh one and "propagate" your identity there
and then remove dead ID server from the list of your sources: "identity migration" (not implemented yet).
This process will be automated and network identification will become much more reliable.


## Install and configure apache2


Lets setup a hostname on your machine if you did not do it before:

        sudo hostname -b my-own-identity-server.com


And you will need to install Apache server if you do not have it yet on your machine:

        sudo apt-get install apache2


Edit Apache2 main config file:
    
        sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf 


You need to add a line to set your domain name:
    
        ServerName my-own-identity-server.com


Create a new `.conf` file for Apache2:

        sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-available/my-own-identity-server_com.conf


Use that template to create Apache2 config, basically you can just copy & paste and only change domain name here:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
          ServerName my-own-identity-server.com
          ServerAlias www.my-own-identity-server.com
          ProxyPreserveHost on
          ProxyRequests Off
          RewriteEngine on
          ProxyPass / http://localhost:8084/
          ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8084/
          Redirect / http://localhost:8084/
          RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:8084/$1 [P,L]
        </VirtualHost>


Enable this configuration in apache2, run command:

        sudo a2enconf my-own-identity-server_com


Configure proxy_http and rewrite modes in apache2, run commands:

        sudo a2enmod proxy_http 
        sudo a2enmod rewrite


Now restart apache2 server:

        sudo service apache2 restart


## Configure BitDust software

First you need to install [BitDust software](https://bitdust.io/install.html) on your machine. 

Now configure BitDust on your node to set domain name for this new identity server, run commands:

        bitdust set services/identity-server/host my-own-identity-server.com
        bitdust set services/identity-server/enabled true


You can manually set a port number for incoming connections using such command:

        bitdust set services/identity-server/web-port 8084



## Run standalone Identity Server

Run this command to start Identity server process in current terminal:

        bitdust identity server start


Now open your favority WEB browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8084](http://127.0.0.1:8084) or [my-own-identity-server.com](my-own-identity-server.com). You should see an empty page with title "Identities on my-own-identity-server.com".

Congratulations! You are running your own identity server now and able to register your own identity there or help other people by hosting their identity files on your machine.


## Run Identity Server as daemon process

Be sure network service identity_server is enabled in settings (check configuration above) and start BitDust software in "daemon" mode:

        bitdust daemon


Be sure ID server is up and running:

        bitdust states | grep id_server
        36: id_server(LISTEN)


Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8084](http://127.0.0.1:8084) or [my-own-identity-server.com](my-own-identity-server.com) to check server status.


## Create dedicated identity

Normally, when you creating a new identity, software will do all stuff for you automatically and just select few random ID servers, ping them and "propagate" your new identity to those nodes.

But you can decide which ID servers you prefer, in case if you would like to control where your identity will be distributed exactly, and modify your "known" ID servers:

    bitdust set services/identity-propagate/known-servers first-server.com:80:6661,second-host.net:8080:6661


Now if you will create a new identity with `bitdust id create my_dedicate_identity` command it will be "propagated" to `first-server.com` and `second-host.net` and your global IDURL can be like that:

    http://first-server.com/my_dedicate_identity.xml


## Support BitDust network

Contact with BitDust team to notify about this new ID server was started on your machine and we will add your domain name in the file __known_servers.py__ storing list of all known BitDust identity servers: 

* [mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/bitdust-io/devel/blob/master/userid/known_servers.py)
* [mirror on dev.bitdust.io](https://dev.bitdust.io/code/devel/blob/master/userid/known_servers.py)

You can Fork BitDust [development repository](https://dev.bitdust.io/code/devel) and open a Pull Request to modify the list of known servers in place.
