# How to become a customer

In this section you will read about how to become a customer of BitDust. We have developed an easy to use application for
Windows, Mac and Linux. We provide maximum flexibility to customers within the settings section in the application. 

## Step 1: Download the application

You can download the application on our homepage or directly from our github page. Choose the correct application for your
Operating System and install it.

## Step 2: Chosing an identity

Once you have installed BitDust on your local machine you need to choose an idenity. You can pick any identity, but it must
consist out of a minimum of 3 characters and a maximum of 20 characters. Only use lowercase numbers and letters. There is no need
to provide any kind of private information when you set-up an identity. Once you have chosen an identity you will go through the
onboarding process.

## Step 3: Backing up your private key

The BitDust application will encrypt all data you store on the network using your private key.
