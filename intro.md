BitDust is a distributed computer network designed for safe information storage and retrieval.
BitDust network is like "digital dust": it works over existing Internet 
connections via secure channels and has a fully distributed structure.

The BitDust project is based on the following principles:

+ equal rights of all participants
+ personal information security
+ anonymous network logon
+ equitable relationship
+ openness and understandability
+ usability


# What for?

BitDust is a holistic ecosystem, the basic idea of which is to complete the decentralization 
of information flows and stored data.

Our goal is to provide all network participants with security, independence, privacy and full 
control over personal data.

Autonomy of each node in the BitDust network and security of all connections allow free flow of
information without possibility of any control, detection or pressure by third parties.


# How?

Instead of the usual interaction model "client-server‚Äù BitDust network uses such links as "user-user."

Connection and transmission of information take place directly from node to node in encrypted 
form - Transport Channels are safe and protected from outside influence.

Like "dust", user data is broken into multiple fragments and stored distributed randomly on machines 
of other users on the principle of "at each other".

Computers of all the users provide a share of their hardware resources in the BitDust network to support 
its operations.
