# Monetization


(This is only the general outline of the entire document, work in progress)


* Each participant in the  network can receive direct or indirect benefits from the provision RESOURCES of his own computer for other users

* People who consume more RESOURCES than give will have to somehow invest their own funds for that would continue to use the services of BitDust society

* Those who donates more RESOURCES  than consume will always be able to enjoy network for FREE

* We started development of a kind of rating system, it is designed to balance and to sponsor active members who give RESOURCES to the BitDust network

* Participants with great ratings will earn more than others

* Users with "negative" rating, will have to contribute funds for that would continue to use the network as usual

* Ratings will be collected for a certain period, such as a month or 50 days

* After this period, all the statistics for this period is reset and all users start again from zero rating

* Those who in the previous rankings were on the top (for example among the best 1-2%) receive "star", which remains in their profiles - is a sign of extreme reliability and trust

* BitDust software will use a some kind of cryptocurrency - blockchain will store the key service information about all active nodes 

* Must always exist an opportunity to stay anonymous on the network without the participation in the rankings and publish IP address  and other personal data

* Anonymous users can only count on the support of volunteers who give their free part RESOURCES your PC

* Here are some parameters which forms the final rating of the user (this is a partial list, work in process):
    * up-time of the node, the longer he continuously work in the network - the higher the rating he will have
    * amount of donated space on his HDD
    * the maximum bandwidth size of his network channel
    * the average volume of the network traffic for the reporting period
    * the amount of users which he supports - this is his clients
    * the number of failures from clients
    * the number of "likes" from customers
    * ratio of paid/unpaid customers which he supports

* Based cryptocurrency be implemented decentralized Exchange RESOURCES, where it will be possible to buy and sell computer RESOURCES

* Those who consumes more than donates, can easily "invest money" to the whole community and "raise" its own rating to be able to stay connected

* Those who supports the BitDust network a lot, will be able to "sell" part of their ranking in exchange for cash
        
* BitDust company can make profits in various ways:
    1. A fully paid applications and services based on BitDust network
    2. A tax on each transaction
    3. In the form of resource users' PCs, which later can be sold to corporate and private clients
    4. In the form of advertising space for other companies
    5. Implementing additional functions to improve the software for private companies exclusively
    6. Accept donations


* Employees of private and public companies, banks, etc. may use along with other network

* Company BitDust may provide special conditions for corporate clients and create a network service that will benefit only those who have received authorization

* BitDust Company may participate in the joint development of commercial products which will not belong to her, but only to use the kernel of the software
