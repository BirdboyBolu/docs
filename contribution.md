# BitDust contribution

Always wanted to work on cool APP for people to use? Here is your chance!

BitDust is looking for a Python developer to help us create an encrypted mobile messaging and file storage app.
This will be your chance to learn new technologies, have fun coding together and shine on the open source front.

BitDust APP also requires amazing UI and we are looking for a super-creative WEB designers and front-end developers to create wonderful user experience in the APP.

Our aim is to provide a healthy alternative to "centralized" social apps and create software that belongs to people,
but not to a commercial organizations. We believe your data must be yours and you should be in full control.

We currently have a working Alpha version and are looking to increase the stability of the platform and add more features.

Read [BitDust Wiki](https://bitdust.io/wiki/) to learn more about the project principles and how it works in general.

Check out [BitDust repositories](https://github.com/bitdust-io/) and see what is already there and start working with the code bases.

This will be a voluntary contribution, but we are working hard to prepare project for further monetization - you will invest in your own future together with other enthusiasts in the field.
