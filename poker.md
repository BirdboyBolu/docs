# Anonymous Poker

I would like to talk a little bit about the latest work on the project. I pretty much moved on the issue of traffic redirection. 

Let me explain. Through this mechanism, the user can obtain the anonymity network like Tor Project doing. This is called onion routing.

All of your traffic will go through another site - as a proxy server.
Your real IP-address will not be published. Everyone else will see only the IP of the host that will help you redirect traffic.

For those who keep their data (your suppliers) does not recognize the address.
Also, if you store the data for the other (to become a supplier), they will not recognize your IP address too. Customers may not know where their data is stored.

This mode can be switched off with the click of the program.

You can set different settings for the periodic change of the node, which redirects traffic. Or it can be set rigidly specify a list of nodes that can redirect traffic.

In particular, it can be very useful for private companies - they will protect their own cars - no one will know, in the real IP-addresses of their machines. Routers can also be controlled by the organization, but to take apart.

I thought online poker. Through this method we can build anonymity 100% anonymously p2p network poker fairly quickly. BitDust code can make all communications, we just need to "draw" green table, cards, games room and other graphical interface. I think it can be done within a few months, if we have a good team.
