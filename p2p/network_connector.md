## Description:    
    
The __network_connector()__ machine is needed to monitor status of the Internet connection
and start reconnect actions in different parts of software.

In __CONNECTED__ state it will periodically checks for incoming traffic and decide about
current connection status.

Two key methods will manage the reconnection process and start/stop some key network services:
    
    * doSetUp() 
    * doSetDown()
    
If some network interfaces is active but software is still disconnected 
it will try to ping "http://bitdust.io" to know what is going on.
