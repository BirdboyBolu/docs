#Ecosystem

The BitDust network is a complex ecosystem. To make the BitDust network functioning there is a complex ecosystem.
This ecosystem consist out of different roles that either use or support the BitDust network. In this section 
we want to provide a short overview of the different roles that make up the BitDust ecosystem. You can click on the 
different roles and see more in-depth information and more importantly on how to become that particular role. 

The BitDust ecosystem consist out of either customers that use the BitDust network for encrypted storage and chat
or out of different supporting roles to make it possible for customers to use the BitDust network.
Currently we have 4 supporting roles that are active and 2 roles that are still being developed. Once all the 6 
supporting roles are live the full power of the BitDust network is unleashed. 

##Becoming a customer of the BitDust network
A customer/user of the BitDust network will have the possibility to install BitDust on their laptop/PC. Once installed
the user can create a identity anonymously and start enjoying the BitDust product. For now once a user has installed
BitDust they can use start using BitDust to be in full control of their data. Every piece of data that runs on the '
network is encrypted with your private key. Nobody else has access unless you provide access. For now we offer the 
following features:

* Anonymously creating a BitDust account
* Upload and download encrypted data
* Share data with trusted contacts
* Add friends/contact to share files with and chat
* Fully encrypted chat between friends/contacts

All of the above features can be accessed via a simple program that you can install on your laptop/PC. We have versions
for Mac, Windows, Linux and Rasberry Pi.

##Becoming a supporter in the BitDust network
To make the BitDust network function there are multiple roles needed to support the network. For now all of the roles
can only be created by using command line. This basically means that you don't have an easy to use interface to set-up
your supporting role, like you have when you use BitDust as a customer/user. We will be making this available in the
future so everybody can join. For now we focus on making it possible to set-up the entire BitDust ecosystem and afterwards
focus on usability so not only developers can fulfill a supporting role, but also grandma with her laptop:).

We currently have the following supporting roles which are live and you can set-up by using command line. They are descibed
in short below. Click on the role to get more detailled information and how to set this role up on your local machine.

## Supporting roles that you can become right now

Supplier:
As a supplier you support the BitDust ecosytem by providing storage to customers. You basically rent out your harddisk space
to customers and get BitBust tokens back as compensation in the future. As a supplier you store encrypted data of customers.
Being a good supplier means also that you keep the customers data stored on your local machine and be connected to the 
internet always. Interested in becoming a supplier then read more about it here (insert link suppliers).

ID Server:
As a customer you need to create an identity to use the BitDust network. This identity is captured in an identity file and
is distributed across the network. Making sure that as a customer you can connect with other customers or other supporting 
roles within the BitDust network. To make this possible you as an ID server hold copies of identity files and make it 
possible for customers to connect and communicate across the BitDust network. Interested in becoming an ID server then read 
more about it here (insert link ID server).

Distributed Hash Table Seed:
As a Distributed Hash Table Seed you maintain service information within the Distributed Hash Table. The Distributed Hash table 
stores service information about everybody that is connected to the network. For instance we store your nickname in the 
Ditributed Hash table or the suppliers a specific customer has. Interested in becoming a Distributed Hash Table Seed
then read  more about it here (insert link DHTS).

Router:
As a router you help other nodes to reach each other within the BitDust network. You help other nodes to send and 
receive encrypted packets. Interested in becoming a Router then read  more about it here (insert link Router).

## Supporting roles that you can become in the future

There are 2 roles that are in development that will support the BitDust ecosystem. When these 2 roles are finished the
BitDust network is fully operational. 

ReBuilder:
Suppliers can go offline due to circumstances. To ensure that your data has a high availability it is the RebBuilders job to 
rebuild the data that was lost at one supplier and move it to another supplier. Read more in detail about our approach here.

Miner:
There are a lot of complex relationships within the BitDust ecosystem and it is important to be transparant about it. We use
blockchain technology to accomplish this. A miner validates transactions within the BitDust Blockchain. Transactions are the 
sending and receiving of BitDust tokens from one users to another. The BitDust token is used to reward supporting roles within
the network. For instance a customer needs BitDust tokens to store data at suppliers. Read more in detail about our
approach here (insert link).
