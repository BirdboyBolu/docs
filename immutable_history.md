A real currency is always like a fluid - same coin can be exchanged for different price in different locations and different situations. Because of this issue every customer must be able to use best currencies suitable for him. But in all cases it must be according to the current market exchange rate - no matter of which currency he was going to use.

Supplier is the guy who define the currency at the begining - he already did some job and gained some GBH on the "balance".
Now supplier can "broadcast" to other nodes a short info about his offer: to sell some amount of GBH. He can do it very slowly and gently. The software will do it in a smart way so other customers always able to "subscribe" for such events and receive those "offers" in real-time. But other users will not be "polutted/spammed" too much.

As customer found a good "offer" to buy a GBH from supplier he can just send a real money directly to him - in any way possible. But supplier wont be albe to accept all of the currencies and all of the payment methods but only several of them. So in the "offer" he will put an info about preferred methods.

After receiving the money supplier will have to accept the payment and "mine/publish" a final coin the "chain" and so mark the contract as "paid".

For example let's take euros as current local currency, and will try to set a price for the storage. 
Consider a customer Alice who agreed to pay 15 euros for 100 GB storage space per one month, so she is fine to spend no more than:

     15 Euros / (100 Gb * 30 days * 24 hours) = 1 Euro for 4800 GBH  or 

She found a supplier Bob who already gained some GBH from Zlatan and willing to sell it for 12 Euros per 100 GB storage per month:

     12 Euros / (100 Gb * 30 days * 24 hours) = 1 Euro for 6000 GBH

But worth to say that nothing about real currencies needs to be defined in the contracts-chain - we only need the actual contract info and the value in GBH. BitDust project is not involved in money transfer at all and have no financial obligations.




## Exchange GBH to real currency


As soon as contract was finished it is possible to calculate the total value from it and finally the real price in some currency.

## 

We love and encourage a free market!. But please note, BitDust project not going to create a new financial system and implement an own currency. You will get more detailed info bellow, but in short: we do not want to accumulate "money" in the network (like BitCoin does), but only count current consumption of resources. When you earn some GBH you will have to spend them quickly (within same calendar "period") or withdraw into cash or another currency.

The software will count resources constantly, but periodically it will do a "reset all counters" procedure. Older contracts will be erased automatically from the contracts-chain database - so at any moment only your last finished contracts will have a "value" for other nodes. It is because other nodes have no profits of storing a huge amount of contracts on own PC.

As soon as contract was finished and rewarded it must be cleaned from the database. If contract was not finished within critical period it will be also cleaned. If contract was finished but was not rewarded (paid) it will be still available for longer period (so other people will see it) and finally also will be cleaned. This is not comfort situation for customer because his reputation will go down, it will be explained bellow.





## Payment of completed contracts

Every customer consume storage from network and so he have to pay at some point. From other side suppliers, who donate a lot of PC resources would like to benefit from that.

Because all operations are reported in publicly accessible contract-chains every user able to calculate total amount of consumed/donated resources by any other user. In other words customer know how much PC resources supplier donated and supplirt know how much resources was consumed by customer.

On this basis, any client can pay any supplier contract. It is not necessary to pay directly to the supplier, who provides you with services. You can transfer money to any supplier, with a preliminary analysis of how much the resources granted to other customers by him. The fact of payment will be recorded in the supplier contracts and thus all the other users on the network will know about it.

The payment process starts from the supplier who wants to get paid for his contracts.



Let's describe the whole process of funds moving from customer to supplier step by step:

1. by request from customer A given cashier B calculates total value of all finished contracts by customer A needs to be paid
2. customer A send money in local currency to cashier B - previously they decide about the price for PC resources






## Cashiers

To inpit/output real money into/from the network we introduce another role: "cashier". Se every user can act as a trade agent (or cashier) and help other users to change real money (in local currency) for PC resources and vice versa.

Any cashier must be able to take obligations for all finished contracts belongs to any particular supplier and pays him in local currency by his request. From other side cashier also should be able to support any single customer and receive money from him in order to get paid for all resources was consumed by this customer.



... later customer will have to pay to one of "cashiers" according to amount of mined coins belongs to him (for all his suppliers). From other side, supplier can go to one of "cashiers" and request for refund - accountant will check how much crypto coins belongs to this supplier and calculate total amount in US $, euro, rubles, etcâ€¦

... to be continue
