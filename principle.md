# How does it work?


## Fully decentralized peer-to-peer network

The whole BitDust network consists of equal nodes, every device acts as a client and server for others at same time. 
The user authorizes in the network by himself and safely interacts with others using his ID and a secret key.


## Distributed Data Storage

Each BitDust network participant have a chance to allocate his data on machines of other users - his suppliers. 
Uploaded data are backed up and organized into RAID array for ensuring possibility of reliable recovery. 


## Automatic Data Recovery

Each supplier gets a double portion of information: the data themselves in encrypted form and RAID-copy, 
which enables recovery by data loss. The whole process is done automatically and does not need 
any action from the user.


## User Information Protection

All service packets are digitaly signed and personal user data is also encrypted with one of his secret keys â€“ suppliers 
do not have access to your data. Only with a correct private key you can restore the uploaded data.


## Anonymous Network Log-On

For network log on you do not need to pass through any authorization, provide your email or phone number. 
There is no support team or call center - BitDust company does not run centralized user information acquisition or users accounting.


## Uses Distributed Hash-Table

Distributed hash-table is used for service information storage, connection between users and maintenance 
of the network as a whole.


## Transmits Data by TCP and UDP

Nodes in the BitDust network are connected to each other directly and data are transmitted using 
the protocols TCP and UDP.


## Users Connections beyond NAT

There are situations when network connection between nodes which are behind NAT cannot be established - receive direct 
incoming connections in regular manner is not possible. In those cases a distributed hash-table for service information 
storage is used, similar to rendezvous-point principle other nodes will help you to connect to the network. 


## Managed by Finite State Machines

BitDust project is developed based on principles of automata-based programming and 
[open project documentation](http://is.ifmo.ru/articles_en/).
This is a programming paradigm in which a program or its fragment is represented as a model of 
some finite state machine.
