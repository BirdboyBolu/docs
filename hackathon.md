## The hackathon

The hackathon will be held online from 21 to 23 January 2021.

All participating teams must register before 10 January 2021 via [this form]().

A team can consist of any number of participants, but preferably we expect teams to be around 5 people on-line.



## The goal

Teams should design, develop and submit their solutions by the time the hackcaton ends.

Soultion should be directly related to the code / goals / ideas of the BitDust project.

The jury will evaluate the work and the result of each team according to three criteria and provide a score from 0 to 10:

* API/framework features
* user interface features
* social/business impact

Thus, each team will receive a three-component grade and the winners are determined by the best overall score.



## Final results

Each team must prepare a short video 5-10 minutes long to present their solution / live-demo and upload the video to [this YouTube channel]() before the end of the hackathon.

Together with the video, the team must submit the results of the work and the developed materials into [this GitHub repository]() to the corresponding sub-folder.

Solutions can be presented in defferent formats:

* UI designs and wireframes can be provided as image files
* presentations/documents are in PDF format
* additional video content uploaded to YouTube
* developed source code is pushed to your GitHub Fork

Within 3 days the jury will have to evaluate the achieved result of each of the teams by reviewing all the materials provided after the end of the hackathon.

The result of the jury's work will be a short video report for each of the teams, in which the jury members explain and give the final score to the team.

All feedback from the jury you will find in that [YouTube channel]().



## Prizes

There are prizes prepared for the winners of the hackathon, which will be paid out in BitCoin.

The exact amount of the prize pool will be announced by 5 January 2021.

After the jury has determined the winners of the hackcaton, the entire prize pool will be distributed as follows:

* the winning team will receive 50% of the whole prize pool
* the team that took 2nd place will receive 25%
* the team that took 3nd place will receive 10%
* 7% will be equally distributed across all mentors
* 5% will be split betwen organizers of the hackathon
* 3% will be equally distributed betwen jury members



## Team efforts evaluation

We would like to support you during the hackathon and use your creativity/passion/skills/knowledge for the development of the BitDust project.

Also we would like to encourage the fair play during the hackathon. We will look thoroughly all of your commits, pictures, PDF, videos, etc. and analize if you are really developed the submitted solution during those 48 hours.

It is totally fine to be well prepared for the hackathon and we encourage that and will try to provide as much support as possible before the hackathon. But jury must be sure about the evaluation - it must be done regarding team efforts during hackathon, not before.

We do not want to create additional restrictions and introduce strict criteria when evaluating the results of each teams. But it should be remembered that the jury will give preference to those teams whose results can be directly or partially incorporated/re-used during the further development of the BitDust project.



## Challenges

Below is a list of several areas/sections that can be taken as a basis when looking for a challenge for the hackcathon if you have not yet found one for yourself:

* messaging solutions (on-line chat, notifications, chat-bots, groups, friends, etc.)
* file storage/transfer/share solutions (UI features, API/framework improvements)
* networking solutions
* economy/blockchain research
* documentation/media content

Please contact your mentor if you need help finding a good challenge for your team.



## Mentors and organizers

After January 10, each team will receive a dedicated mentor/expert who will help in the preparation for the hackathon.

You will contact your mentor via chat and from there can start on-line meetings if it is necessary.

In addition, a chat-group will be created for all participants of the hackathon, where you will receive support from the organizers and BitDust developers.
